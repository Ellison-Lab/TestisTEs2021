***Supplementary Figure 2. TE expression in scRNA-seq data from larval testes.*** **a)** Violin plots show distributions of raw transposable element-mapping (TE) unique molecular identifier (UMI) counts in each w1118 L3 testis cell cluster. TE counts vary significantly among the clusters (Kruskal-Wallis, one-sided p < 2.2e-16). **b)** Violin plots show distributions of depth normalized TE-mapping UMI counts in each w1118 L3 testis cell cluster. TE counts vary significantly among the clusters (Kruskal-Wallis, one-sided p < 2.2e-16). **c)** Scatterplots show pseudo-bulk expression for both TEs and host genes derived from our w1118 scRNA pipeline (see Methods) versus bulk expression for four w1118 testis poly-A RNA-seq replicates generated by Mahadevaraju et al. 2021 (see Methods). Each replicate shows strong correlation with pseudo-bulk (all Pearson's R >= 0.89, two-sided P<2.2e-16). **d)** Scatterplots show same analysis described in **d** but restricted to TEs (all Pearson's R >= 0.85, two-sided P<2.2e-16). **e)** Heatmaps show distribution of sense-strand bulk poly-A RNA-seq signal for single-isoform host gene mRNAs (left) and detected TEs (right). Larval bulk poly-A RNA-seq data generated by Mahadevaraju et al. 2021 was mapped to each feature (see Methods) and divided into bins representing one tenth the full length of each feature. **f)** Boxplots show standard deviations of expression across bins for host genes (gray) and TEs (red). Three of four replicates show no significant difference in variability of poly-A signal across bins within features (Wilcoxon rank-sum test P>0.05). Replicate 3 shows a significant difference (Wilcoxon rank-sum test, two-sided P=0.047). For all boxplots, midline represents median, box represents interquartile range (IQR), and whiskers extend >1.5 IQR from the upper or lower quartile. **g)** Bar plot shows number of TE-gene chimeric transcripts reproducibly found in bulk poly-A RNA-seq data, for all TEs with a least one chimeric transcript identified in at least two of the replicate RNA-seq datasets. **h)** For each TE introduced in G, the y-axis position of each point represents the number of uniquely-mapping chimeric reads detected by STAR that support each chimeric transcript (see Methods).

***Supplementary Figure 3. Co-expression module detection via consensus approach to Independent Component Analysis (cICA).*** **a)** Final module gene membership scores were compared to modules identified in replicate consensus independent component analysis (cICA) runs by Spearman correlation. For each module, the two-sided correlation p-values for the best correlated module from each cICA replicate are plotted. Modules (x axis) are ordered by the Spearman correlation with the best match across all three cICA replicates. Error band on the trendline represents fitted value +/- standard error. **b)** Histogram shows distribution of the number of genes or transposable elements (TEs) assigned to the set of modules used in main analysis.  **c)** Barplots show percentage of modules uniquely enriched for at least one Biological Process (BP), Cellular Component (CC), or Molecular Function (MF) Gene Ontology Term.Source data are provided as a Source Data file.
